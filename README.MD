# **Ask Your Professor** 

## Summary
Ask Your Professor is an instant messaging app that facilitates Q&A sessions between students and professors. Right now, this app only works with UVA classes (with access to the Lou's List API) and has only been tested on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (although it might work with other Android phones)

## Description:
AskYourProfessor provides an instant messaging service that enables college students to more effectively ask questions during lecture. Traditionally, a college student asks questions during lecture by raising their hand, waiting for some amount of time, directing every other student’s attention to them, and then pausing the lecture to have the professor answer their questions. 

This format has numerous flaws: 
It is frustrating for the student. The student must raise their hand and keep it raised for a potentially frustrating amount of time so that they can be recognized by the professor, which might disinterest the student in asking that question and force them to give up on it. It breaks the flow of the lecture. Asking spontaneous questions creates spontaneous interruptions for the professor, thereby distracting them and generally ruining the flow of the lecture, leading to a more disjointed and less engaging experience. It discourages asking questions. In addition to students trying to compete to have their questions answered first in class, asking questions in general is seen as an inconvenience to other students, since doing so interrupts and pauses the lecture. Few students want to be “that person” by asking questions, and thus are less likely to do so. It wastes time. Communicating a query verbally to a professor is often slower, harder to understand, and more error-prone than, for instance, communicating via reasonably well-written text messages.

AskYourProfessor would fix these problems by allowing a student to effortlessly, quickly, and anonymously type their query on their device and send it to the professor’s phone, who would intermittently pause the lecture when they think it’s convenient to view the query feed on their phone and answer them in a prioritized and rapid-pace fashion, while still keeping a steady train of thought, uninterrupted by spontaneous questions.
